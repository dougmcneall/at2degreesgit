Code and data for the analysis in “How Much CO2 at 1.5degC and 2degC?” By Richard Betts and Doug McNeall, Nature Climate Change, 2018

## Getting Started

The main analysis code is R script [uncertaintyTCR.R](https://github.com/dougmcneall/at2degreesgit/blob/master/uncertaintyTCR.R). Some of the plots in the supplementary material were generated by [conc_v_emis_plots.R](https://github.com/dougmcneall/at2degreesgit/blob/master/conc_v_emis_plots.R).

Data files tcrpdf.txt and atcrpdf.txt are taken directly from Richardson et al (2016)
[“Reconciled climate response estimates from climate models and the energy budget of Earth”](https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate3066), for which the authors posted their [code and data](http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~kdc3/papers/reconciled2016/). We would like to thank them for making this paper fantastically easier to write.


### Prerequisites

These scripts will run in the R language for statistical computing https://www.r-project.org.


## Authors

* **Doug McNeall** (https://github.com/dougmcneall) wrote the code, and did the analysis with Richard Betts, based on an initial idea by RB.
