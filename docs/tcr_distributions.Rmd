## Possible distributions for TCR

There are a number of estimates for the pdf of TCR. Here are some possible fits to the stated distributions.



## Quantiles from the literature

There are a number of sources of assessed probability distributions (sometimes just quantiles) in the literature. A complicating factor is that they often give a small number of different quantiles, or probability ranges, leaving a large number of potential distributions that would fit. For example, they might state a 66% probability range, without specifying the quantiles this range apllies to.


### AR5 (assessed range)

"likley" range (66% probability)

1 - 2.5 deg C

Also "positive" and "extremely unlikely" (5% probability) above 3"

I interpret this as

| quantile  |  0% |  22% | 78% | 97.5% |
|-----------|-----|------|-----|-------|
|     tcr   |  0  | 1    | 2.5 |  3    |


But it's possible to interpret that upper quantile as 95%, as there is ambiguity around whether the 5% probability should be split over both tails of the distribution. . I'll update this possible inconsistancy as I find out. 

### CMIP5 models
AR5 Box 12.2 states:

"5 to 95% range of CMIP5 (1.2°C to 2.4°C; see Table 9.5), is positive and extremely unlikely greater than 3°C." As this explicitly mentions the 95% *and* the "extremely unlikely" statement, that lends evidence that "extremely unlikely" is spread over both tails, and refers to the 97.5th percentile.

| quantile  |  0% |  5% | 95% | 97.5% |
|-----------|-----|-----|-----|-------|
|     tcr   |  0  | 1.2 | 2.5 |  3    |


### Schurer eta al (2018)

Multimodel mean with increased variance for model uncertainty

| quantile  |  5% | 50% | 95% |
|-----------|-----|-----|-----|
|     tcr   | 1.2 | 1.7 | 2.4 |


### Sherwood et al (2020)

Likely (66% probability) range

| quantile  | 22% | 50% | 78% |
|-----------|-----|-----|-----|
|     tcr   | 1.5 | 1.8 | 2.2 |



## Distributions used in Betts & McNeall (2018)

```{r}
dx = 100
tcr_range = seq(from = 0, to = 5, by = 1/dx)

```

```{r}
# Very approximately, the TCR distribution is N(1.75, 0.5)
# MC sample, and plug that into the transfer function
# Still to do: pick a closer mean/sd (perhaps non normal?)
tcrmean = 1.75
tcrsd_used = 0.45 # incorrectly used in the paper.
tcrsd = 0.97  # The final result is very sensitive to lower tail of tcr distribution

qnorm(p = c(0.22, 0.78), mean = tcrmean, sd = tcrsd_used)
qnorm(p = c(0.22, 0.78), mean = tcrmean, sd = tcrsd)

# A plot of what the assumed tcr distribution looks like
tcrdens_used = dnorm(tcr_range, mean = tcrmean, sd = tcrsd_used)
#tcrsamp_used  = rnorm(10000, mean = tcrmean, sd = tcrsd_used)

tcrdens = dnorm(tcr_range, mean = tcrmean, sd = tcrsd)
#tcrdens = 
plot(tcr_range, tcrdens_used, type = 'l', lwd = 2, main = "pr(TCR)", xlab = "TCR", ylab = "Probability density" )
lines(tcr_range, tcrdens, col = 'red' )
legend('topright', c('used in paper', 'corrected Normal distribution'), lty = 'solid', col = c('red', 'black'))
```



## Other distributions to might fit TCR better

The distribution from Richardson is asymmetric, and there is evidence that the other distributions representing scientists beliefs are asymmetric too. Normal distributions can easily place significant probability below zero, which is explicitly ruled out in the AR5 assessment.

Other distributions, such as Gamma or lognormal, might fit better.

For example, here is a Gamma distribution with some sensible-looking parameters.

```{r}

gdens <- dgamma(x = tcr_range, shape = 5, rate = 3)

plot(tcr_range, gdens, type = 'l', lwd = 2, main = "pr(TCR)", xlab = "TCR", ylab = "Probability density" )

```

## Fit distributions to the Richardson samples from their TCR distribution


```{r}
# Load Richardson TCR samples from distribution
atcrpdf = as.numeric(readLines("../richardson/atcrpdf.txt"))
atcrpdf.trunc = atcrpdf[atcrpdf<12 & atcrpdf >0]
```

```{r}
library(fitdistrplus)
```

Fit the Gamma distribution, starting from the above parameters.

```{r}
start.gamma <- list(shape = 5, rate = 3)
fit.gamma <- fitdist(atcrpdf.trunc, distr = "gamma", method = "mle", start = start.gamma)
summary(fit.gamma)

```

```{r}

plot(fit.gamma)

```

### Fit a lognormal distribution to Richardson

This seems to fit a little better than the Gamma distribution.


```{r}
# lognormal?
# A lognormal distribution seems to fit the 

fit.lnorm <- fitdist(atcrpdf.trunc, distr = "lnorm", method = "mle")
summary(fit.lnorm)

plot(fit.lnorm)

exp(fit.lnorm$estimate)

```

## Fit a lognormal distribution to all of the distributions from the literature
